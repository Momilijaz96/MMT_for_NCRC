This repo is a placeholder for official implementation of the paper "Multimodal transformer for Nurse Activity Recognition", published in CVPM2020, CVPRW.

# Introduction
This paper proposes a novel transformer based real world action recognition method. The proposed method involves two single modality transformer models, for performing action recogniton on [Nurse-Activity-Recogntion-dataset(2019)](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/nurse-care-activity-recognition-challenge).
